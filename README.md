# MinionAWS

MD stands for Minion Data, the difference between MD_gui and MD_terminal is clear. 
after cloning run install.py to install all dependices it is assumed that the user already has python and pip. Then the AWS cli must be configured, since this is different on 
different operating systems refere to the AWS documentation for how to install [aws cli](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/). Wether you use terminal_app.py or gui_app.py make sure that they are 
run from the same directory as MinionAws folder.

default_dir is used when there is no directory specified in the program.
